Good to hear!

BTW: I also own a pegasus workstation and it may sense to add the PPC porting 
results to the Schillix-ON tree. Do you know whom best to aproach for this?

For future discussions on the Schillix-ON project, I would like to see you in 
the <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/schillix-on-devel">schillix-on-devel at lists.berlios.de</A> mailing list. You may subscribe here:

&gt;<i> I have been reading the various things I seee at berlios and I was

</I>&gt;<i> self
</I>&gt;<i> hosting
</I>
Correct, this happened after I replaced some code by OSS code and after I 
switched to Illumos (wbem and dhcpmgr did not compile because they depend on
the closed source and non-redistributable providerutility.jar).

Since yesterday, the related issue-fix from Illumos has been reviewed and 
integrated into Schillix-ON, so Schillix-ON is also self hosting.

</I>&gt;<i>        I was thinking that we need GCC 4.5.2 to be able to build
</I>&gt;<i>        the OS with available open source assemblers and linkers.

</I>&gt;<i>        Do we have the source to ld ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    *************/
</I>
We cannot use the assembler from gcc to compile the machine code files,
but I did already talk to the author of &quot;yasm&quot; and he seems to be interested in
creating a variant that is CLI compatible to /usr/ccs/bin/as and also 
inderstands the x86 syntax used by Sun.

Regarding GCC-4.x, the ON source compiles with GCC-3.4.3 but I'v heard that
the binaries no longer work. Somebody would need to check whether Schillix-ON
compiles with GCC-4.x and when this is done, somebody needs to check whether the
result works or not.


&gt;<i> Note that sunstudio-12.1 is buggy and does not create correct code for
</I>&gt;<i> e.h. &quot;hsfs&quot; in 64 bit mode.
</I>
We now know what happens: SS12.1 does not properly auto-cast the computation 
from 32 bit ints to 64 bits ints that happen in the hsfs/RR time stamp 
conversion from the internal format to the UNIX format. It seems that Snorcle 
has a workaround using explicit casts.

&gt;<i>   /**********
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I had problems with SunStudio 12 Update 1 for a long time. I no
</I>&gt;<i> longer install it at all. I find that Sun Studio 11 and 12 work
</I>&gt;<i> well for most things but I refuse to use Sun Studio 12 update 1 at
</I>&gt;<i> all anymore.
</I>
Another problem - but not inside the compiler - is the fact that due to a wish 
from Roland Mainz, 12.1 defaults to -xstrconst. This has been reported to e.g.
break /usr/bin/ls (the color code....) and to let it coredump.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Note that the assembler that comes with sunstudio-12 does not
</I>&gt;<i> understand all assembler files from onnv/Illumos build 147+, so
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i>         need to install both sunstudio-12 and sunstudio-12.1. sunstudio-12.1
</I>&gt;<i>         is needed for the assembler, sunstudio-12 is needed for compiling
</I>&gt;<i>         C-code correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  /*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     What a pain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   */
</I>
Well, the problem is that ONNV does not contain the source for /usr/ccs/bin/as.

&gt;<i> I want to change many things in my life and in work for 2011. One of the
</I>&gt;<i> things that mad me sad and angry last year was the total failure of Sun
</I>&gt;<i> and then the further failure of OpenSolaris under Oracle. This was not the
</I>
What we stil do not know is whether Oracle will ever continue to contribute to 
OpenSolaris and iff, how much of the code will be contributed.

&gt;<i> fault of the community however I question the intentions of Garret D'Amore
</I>&gt;<i> and the Illumos project. I think you have a better understanding of what
</I>&gt;<i> open source is and how UNIX works within a community. You observations are
</I>&gt;<i> generally scientific in nature, with proof or at least with data. Not
</I>&gt;<i> merely opinion. I think that we should look at 2011 as the year that we
</I>&gt;<i> see a full distro alive again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the new Blastwave stack could help in this regard also ?
</I>
The main reason for creating Schillix-ON is to have a ON base development 
project with the same goals as SchilliX. 

The goals for Schillix-ON are:

-	be close to the Solaris interfaces

-	to become fully OSS as soon as possible

-	to be independent from company interests

The SchilliX distro project is a different issue, the next things to do is to
compile Xorg and GNOME and to create packages. Packaging needs to be discussed
too, but this should be done separately.
